      "prediction": "<think>\nThe problem involves the conservation of energy. The kinetic energy of the canister is converted into the potential energy stored in the compressed spring. The kinetic energy of the canister can be calculated using the formula \\( KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\). The potential energy stored in the spring is given by \\( PE = \\frac{1}{2}kd^2 \\). Setting these equal gives us the equation to solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}kd^2 \\]\n\nRearranging for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d^2 = \\frac{mv^2}{k} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{mv^2}{k}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values \\( m = 0.40 \\, \\text{kg} \\), \\( v = 0.50 \\, \\text{m/s} \\), and \\( k = 750 \\, \\text{N/m} \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.40 \\, \\text{kg} \\times (0.50 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}{750 \\, \\text{N/m}}} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.40 \\times 0.25}{750}} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.10}{750}} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{1.33 \\times 10^{-4}} \\]\n\n\\[ d \\approx 0.0115 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo, the distance \\( d \\) the spring is compressed is approximately \\( 0.0115 \\, \\text{m} \\), which we round to one decimal place as \\( 0.0 \\, \\text{m} \\) is not a reasonable answer in this context.

Since AB = AC and ∠CAB = 40°, we have an isosceles triangle ABC. The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180°, so ∠ABC = 180° - 40° - 40° = 100°. In parallelogram ABCD, opposite angles are equal, so ∠D = ∠B = 100°. However, this does not match the given options. Revisiting the problem, we see that the correct angle for ∠D, using the properties of the parallelogram, is actually calculated as 180° - 100° = 80°, but this is not an option. Given the options, the correct angle for ∠D, based on the properties of the parallelogram and the isosceles triangle, is 100° - 40° = 60°, which matches option (C).\n\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Therefore, the sum of the angles in quadrilateral OBCD is 360°.

      "answer": "13",
      "prediction": "<think>\nThe problem involves understanding how the equilibrium vapor pressure of water changes with temperature, assuming relative humidity remains constant. The vapor pressure of water is given by the equation for the saturation vapor pressure, which is a function of temperature. The saturation vapor pressure \\(E(T)\\) at temperature \\(T\\) can be approximated using the formula:\n\n\\[ E(T) = E_0 \\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)^{5/2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(E_0\\) is the saturation vapor pressure at reference temperature \\(T_0\\). Here, the reference temperature \\(T_0\\) is 290 K, and the current temperature is increased by 2.0 K, making it 292 K. The saturation vapor pressure at 290 K is given as 0.0189 bar.\n\nFirst, we calculate the saturation vapor pressure at the new temperature (292 K):\n\n\\[ E(292) = 0.0189 \\left(\\frac{292}{290}\\right)^{5/2} \\]\n\n\\[ E(292) = 0.0189 \\left(1.006897\\right)^{2.5} \\]\n\n\\[ E(292) \\approx 0.0192 \\text{ bar} \\]\n\nThe relative increase in water vapor pressure is the ratio of the new vapor pressure to the old vapor pressure:\n\n\\[ \\text{Relative increase} = \\frac{E(292)}{E(290)} = \\frac{0.0192}{0.0189} \\approx 1.016 \\]\n\nThis means the vapor pressure increases by about 1.6%, but we need the relative increase in water vapor content, not just pressure. Since relative humidity remains constant, the relative increase in water vapor content is the same as the relative increase in vapor pressure.\n\nTherefore, the relative increase in water vapor in the atmosphere is approximately 16%.\n\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{16}",

Let's denote the equivalent resistance by \\( R_{eq} \\).\n\nFor an infinite chain, the resistance can be approached by considering a finite section and then extending the concept to infinity. Consider the first few resistors to find a pattern.\n\n1. The circuit can be split into two parts: the left part and the right part, each contributing to the equivalent resistance.\n2. The left part from the first resistor to the point where we can consider the infinite repetition can be analyzed.

Since ∠BAP + ∠QAC = ∠BAC, we have ∠PAQ = 180° - 110° = 70°.

But the correct interpretation is that the internal angles are split, so the correct angle is actually 180° - 2*55° = 70°.\n\nBut the correct and simplified reasoning is that since the symmetries split the angles, the angle ∠PAQ is actually half the difference, which simplifies to 180° - 2*55° = 70°.\n\nHowever, the correct and direct calculation is based on the fact that the sum of the angles around point A is 360°, and since the symmetries split the angles, the angle ∠PAQ is actually 180° - 2*55° = 70°.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the angle ∠PAQ is 40°.\n\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{C}",

      "prediction": "<think>\nThe problem involves calculating the \\(x\\)-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 due to the other particles. The electrostatic force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: \\(F = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}\\), where \\(k\\) is the Coulomb constant, \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the charges, and \\(r\\) is the distance between them. The force is also vectorial, so we need to consider the directions of the forces.\n\n1. **Force due to \\(q_2\\):**\n   - The distance between \\(q_3\\) and \\(q_2\\) is the diagonal of the square, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \\(r = \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{2a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The force \\(F_{32}\\) is directed along the line joining \\(q_3\\) and \\(q_2\\), which is along the \\(x\\)-axis for particle 3. The magnitude of \\(F_{32}\\) is \\(F = k \\frac{q_3 q_2}{(a\\sqrt{2})^2} = k \\frac{200 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 100 \\times 10^{-9}}{2a^2} = k \\frac{20000 \\times 10^{-18}}{2 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-2})^2} = k \\frac{20000 \\times 10^{-18}}{2 \\times 25 \\times 10^{-4}} = k \\frac{20000 \\times 10^{-18}}{50 \\times 10^{-4}} = k \\frac{20000}{50} \\times 10^{-14} = 400k \\times 10^{-14}\\).\n   - The \\(x\\)-component of \\(F_{32}\\) is \\(F_{32x} = F \\cos \\theta = F \\frac{a}{r} = 400k \\times 10^{-14} \\times \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{5.0\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-2}} = 400k \\times 10^{-14} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 400k \\times 10^{-14} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 200\\sqrt{2}k \\times 10^{-14}\\).\n\n2. **Force due to \\(q_4\\):**\n   - The distance between \\(q_3\\) and \\(q_4\\) is \\(a\\), and the force \\(F_{34}\\) is also along the \\(x\\)-axis but in the opposite direction (since \\(q_4\\) has the same charge as \\(q_2\\) but is on the opposite side).\n   - The magnitude of \\(F_{34}\\) is the same as \\(F_{32}\\), so \\(F_{34x} = -200\\sqrt{2}k \\times 10^{-14}\\).\n\n3. **Net \\(x\\)-component of the force on particle 3:**\n   - The net \\(x\\)-component of the force on particle 3 is \\(F_{netx} = F_{32x} + F_{34x} = 200\\sqrt{2}k \\times 10^{-14} - 200\\sqrt{2}k \\times 10^{-14} = 0\\).\n\nHowever, the calculation above seems to have an error in the interpretation of the forces. The correct approach is to re-evaluate the forces considering the correct directions and magnitudes.\n\nThe correct \\(x\\)-component of the net electrostatic force on particle 3 is the sum of the forces from \\(q_2\\) and \\(q_4\\), which is \\(F_{netx} = 2 \\times 200\\sqrt{2}k \\times 10^{-14} \\cos 45^\\circ = 2 \\times 200\\sqrt{2}k \\times 10^{-14} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 200k \\times 10^{-14} \\times 2 = 400k \\times 10^{-14}\\).\n\nGiven the values, the final answer is the force in Newtons, which is \\(F = 400 \\times 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\times 10^{-14} = 3.596 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 3.60 \\times 10^{-3}\\) N.\n\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{3.59}",

As \\( t \\) approaches infinity, the rate of change of \\( Q \\) approaches 0, so we have:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\frac{3}{4} \\implies Q_L = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 100 = 75 \\text{ lb}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( Q_0 = 2 \\times 75 = 150 \\) lb. The initial value problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{3}{100} Q = \\frac{3}{4}\n\\]\n\nWith initial condition \\( Q(0) = 150 \\).\n\nTo find the time \\( T \\) after which the salt level is within 2% of \\( Q_L \\), we solve the differential equation. The solution to this first-order linear differential equation is given by:\n\n\\[\nQ(t) = 75 + (150 - 75) e^{-\\frac{3}{100} t} = 75 + 75 e^{-\\frac{3}{100} t}\n\\]\n\nWe need \\( Q(T) \\) to be within 2% of \\( Q_L = 75 \\):\n\n\\[\n75 + 75 e^{-\\frac{3}{100} T} = 75 \\times (1 - 0.02) = 73.5\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n75 e^{-\\frac{3}{100} T} = -1.5 \\implies e^{-\\frac{3}{100} T} = \\frac{-1.5}{75} = -0.02 \\text{ (not possible, recheck the sign)}\n\\]\n\nCorrectly,\n\n\\[\n75 e^{-\\frac{3}{100} T} = 1.5 \\implies e^{-\\frac{3}{100} T} = \\frac{1.5}{75} = 0.02 \\implies -\\frac{3}{100} T = \\ln(0.02) \\implies T = -\\frac{100 \\ln(0.02)}{3}\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator,\n\n\\[\nT \\approx \\frac{100 \\times (-3.912)}{3} \\approx 130.4 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{130.4}",

The area of an equilateral triangle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times \\text{side}^2\\). Since △A'BC and △AB'C are constructed on the sides of the right triangle ABC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the right triangle as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) where \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), we can find \\(b^2\\):\n\n\\[b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = \\frac{40}{\\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{24}{\\sqrt{3}} = 8\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of △ABC' is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times b^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 8 = 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2 = 8\\).\n\nSo, the area of △ABC' is 8.</think>\n\n\\boxed{C}",

We need to find the angle ∠CTD.\n\n1. Since CT is a tangent to the semicircle at T, and the radius of the semicircle at T is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency, we have that ∠CTA = 90 degrees.\n2. Because ABCD is a square, all its internal angles are 90 degrees, and the diagonals AC and BD bisect each other and are equal in length, making ∠CAD = ∠ACD = 45 degrees.\n3. Since CT is a tangent and AT is a radius, ∠CTA = 90 degrees. This makes triangle CTA a right-angled triangle at T.\n4. In the right-angled triangle CTA, since AC is the diagonal of the square, it splits the square into two 45-degree angles at A and C. Therefore, ∠CAD = 45 degrees and ∠ACD = 45 degrees.\n5. Since ∠CTA = 90 degrees and AC is the diagonal, the angle ∠CTD can be found by considering the straight line through C, which is 180 degrees. Therefore, ∠CTD = 180 degrees - 90 degrees - 45 degrees = 45 degrees.\n\nHowever, the angle ∠CTD is actually half of the difference between 180 degrees and the right angle at T, which is 45 degrees. But since we are looking at the angle directly, it is simply 45 degrees.\n\nBut, the angle ∠CTD is actually 45 degrees, as the semicircle and the tangent properties give us that the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the angle ∠CTD is 22.5 degrees.\n\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{22.5}",

The correct approach is to use the fact that the angle ∠ACB is half the difference of the central angles subtended by the same arc, which in this case is half the difference of 180° - 50° = 130°, giving us ∠ACB = 65°.\n\nTherefore, the size of ∠ACB is 65°.</think>\n\n\\boxed{A}",

The minimum value of PQ occurs when CP is the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the tangent line, which forms a 30° angle with the radius.
